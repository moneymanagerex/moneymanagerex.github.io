We test our software against multiple operating systems to ensure compatibility with the currently available version of MMEX. Our developers are typically using the most recent versions of operating systems and we therefore rely on users reporting issues with earlier versions.
It should be noted that for operating systems not listed below MMEX may indeed work but we have had no reports of compatibility.</description></item><item><title>Development</title><link>https://moneymanagerex.org/docs/downloads/development/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://moneymanagerex.org/docs/downloads/development/</guid><description>Beta/Development Builds # Use unstable builds for early testing before official release.
